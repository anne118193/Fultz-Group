Setup for obtaining statistical data for computation of 
the melting temperature with error

# Also all scripts here work for my docker container
# You can download it from my docker account (see instruction below)

# Use the following command to download (NERSC users; both on cori and perlmutter)
# All scripts are load this container
shifterimg -v pull docker:wolanddream/python_mpi:lammps_hdf5

# If you are writing your own job scripts with the use of the container
# just include the following line
"#SBATCH --image=docker:wolanddream/python_mpi:lammps_hdf5"

# create_T_folder 

creates folder for specific temprerature T

# setup
general setup 

# setup/liquid
Simulates liquid to obtain reference temperature of the pure liquid

# setup/solid_coex
Simulates pure solid and melting

# HOW TO RUN

./create_T_folder.sh T

cd TK
cd liquid

sbatch job.sl

# wait till liquid simulation finishes

cd ../
./create_stat_folders.sh

# wait till finish (5 hours each, can take a few days)

In each folder the should be (ideally) SYSTEM_P_N.poss where SYSTEM is you tag (see README) P is your pressure and N is number of atoms

cat */SYSTEM_P_N.poss >> SYSTEM_P_N.poss

You are done!!!
