Notes how to adjust to your own system

In setup
1. Substitute supercell_lammps liquid and solid_melt folders
   supercell_lammps here correspond to conventional unit cell
   can be generated with TDEP from infile.ucposcar by call
   generate_structure -d 1 1 1 -of 3
2. Replace masses in lammps in.liquid and in.melt files
3. Replace lattice parameter value to one of your system
   "variable latparam  equal 5.78"

4. Replace SYSTEM tag in create_T_folder.sh if not Ge

Additional options
#5. Replace N in all job.sl if cell is not diamond (also think about fcc cell
#  generation, may be replace everything with just reading large supercell)
#6. Replace P in atm if not 1
