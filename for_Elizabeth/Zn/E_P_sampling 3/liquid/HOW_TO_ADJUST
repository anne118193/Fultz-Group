Here are notes how to adjust to your own system

1. Be aware of your cell 

The example is generated for diamond cell so in order
to optimize it for your system

A. Replace the "supercell_lammps"
B. In "run_sym.sh" make sure you understand what 'lat_param'
   'quat' and 'half' and 'third' means (this are portion of
   lattice constant I have as a placeholders for generation of
   conventional unit cell with particular volume)
C. If unit cell not fcc change lattice in "LIQ.in" 

2. Replace (T,V, N) net for your system 

In "script_gen.py" replace generation of T and V (hope someone who 
is reading this is familiar with python) and N (multiplicity of unit cell in each dimention)

Note: volume i use for setup is volume of cubic conventional unit cell

3. Replace "pot.mtp" for one from your system

4. Replace mass in each lammps script to mass of your element or several elements
(does not mater)

5. Ajdust 'a_melt' and 'T_melt' in "LIQ.in"
