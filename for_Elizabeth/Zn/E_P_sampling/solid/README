Setup for solid phase

# HOW TO RUN

# Generate net in (T,V) and jobs (each job correspond to single point)

python3.6 script_gen.py

# SUBMITTING JOBS

for i in {1..25}; do
sbatch job.sl
done

# After jobs will FINISH
# Check if jobs obtained substantial amount of statistis 
# (I recommend doing 4800000 steps in total 
# which states for 16 x 30 statistical points)

# If the final step is not reached
# Determine which points are not fully computed
# Regenerate scripts for them

python3.6 script_gen.py 

# Run ones which are not finished

# REFERENCE E0

# Go to E0_ref folder

cd E0_ref

# Run folder generator 

./create_folder.sh

# Submit job (should take 30 mins)

sbatch job.sl


You are done!!!
